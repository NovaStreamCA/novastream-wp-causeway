# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches whenever possible for security vulnerabilities for supported versions of this project.

| Supported Versions | Release Date       |
| -------------------|------------------- |
| 1.0.x              | March 2024         |

## Reward

Please note, we do currently offer a “bug bounty” program; thus, we extend no offer of compensation/reward or public recognition for submittal of potential vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To disclose a potential vulnerability, please email **[support@novastream.ca](mailto:support@novastream.ca)** only.

## Acknowledgement and Response
When a report is received by us, an acknowledgement will be sent in reply to the sender within five business days.
A follow-on request for further information may be sent as needed. After validation/verification of a vulnerability, another follow-up reply will be sent to the sender.


Once an issue is confirmed, we will release an update as soon as possible depending on complexity.

## Recognition
Thank you for responsibly notifying us about potential findings about gaps in our security.
